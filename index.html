				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Gamification is the application of game elements (point systems, badges, competing with others, interactivity, graphics) to existing courses to encourage engagement and participation. The idea is to take elements that make games fun and exciting and applying them in a non-game context.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Gamification is proven to make course material more engaging and motivating than traditional teaching methods. It adds an interactive element that immerses those who are learning the course material. This immersion improves knowledge absorption and retention by rewarding students to learn more. 
			<br /><br />
			Some more benefits include:<br />
				- Freedom to fail and try again without negative repercussions<br />
				- Ability to increase course difficulty at the same pace as learning, minimizing frustration with either material that is too difficult or too easy<br />
				- Provides a manageable set of subtasks that rewards completion <br />
				- More accessible to students with disabilities <br />
				- Making learning visible by displaying progress and awards<br />

            <p>Keeping the concerns of visually impaired students in mind, our website provides listening options at every exercise within the course material. Students are able to input data and answer questions with speech-to-text as well.

Additionally, all exercises that contain some sort of auditory component has the audio description tagged along with it. These audio tags can be made visible through the settings for students with hearing difficulties.

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Integrating gamification into your courses does not require a large shift in traditional teaching methods. For example, students can be rewarded for participating in discussions or answering a question another student asks. This reward system encourages students to participate in and actively learn your course material
<br /><br />
Listed are some game-based tools to use in your teaching:</a><br />
<a href="https://info.credly.com/">Credly https://info.credly.com/</a> a tool to award badges to students for completing tasks in your course<br />
<a href="https://www.openbadges.org/">OpenBadges https://www.openbadges.org/</a> another tool to award badges for students, options to create unique badges<br />
<a href="https://tophat.com/ ">TopHat https://tophat.com/</a> classroom response system that requires students to compete with each other and respond to questions in-class<br />

            <p>Similar to regular courses, online course materials can only be accessed by students with a valid Ryerson email. Use of your intellectual property for distribution, sale or profit without authorization is academic misconduct under Ryerson Policy 60 Academic Integrity. </p>
<br />
If students share your online gamified courses without authorization, you may register an academic misconduct with the Ryerson Academic Integrity Officer here: <a href="https://www.ryerson.ca/academicintegrity/faculty/reporting/">https://www.ryerson.ca/academicintegrity/faculty/reporting/</a>

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>We offer an extensive suite of tools that allows professors to track the progress of their students. These tools allow you to monitor how long each student has spent on a subtask, and how much time on average it took them to complete it. 
Additionally, the professors panel shows which subtasks students struggled with, on average how many tries it took to complete, and how many tasks were completed overall. All this information is visually displayed with a calendar so that the activity of students can be seen alongside lecture and assignment dates.

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>With years of studying gone by and more to come, and on top of that an even busier schedule in university, gamification allows students to learn while also breaking from the monotony of study.
<br /><br />
As an educational tool, gamification can help to increase concept retention within students, resulting in increased student success in and outside of university. Gamification also provides a great appeal to prospective students through this fun way of learning, that gives Ryerson a significant edge over other institutes.

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>We will always gratefully accept any funding from administrative and student groups.
Administrative groups can help us by pushing for a greater discussion within different faculties about the integration of gamified material within different programs.
<br /><br />
Student groups can always invite and engage with us in events and sessions to raise awareness about the benefits of gamification. Students are encouraged to contact faculty and administrative staff to inform them about their support for the gamification of learning at Ryerson.

In the future we hope to build our team and expertise so that we can expand to faculties outside of Computer Science.</p>
